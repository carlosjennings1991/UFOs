# Searching for UFO's

For this project, we review a large dataset of purported UFO sightings. Each instance includes a date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments (screenshot below).

The technical aspect was to convert this data, which was given as a large JavaScript array, into a table which would be dynamically filtered on a website, which itself was also customized to be mobile responsive and reflect a desired aesthetic.
